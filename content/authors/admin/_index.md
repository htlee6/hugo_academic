I am currently a graduate student in System Science at Beijing Normal University and a member of [BrainAIR](http://www.brainair.cn) Lab, advised by [Prof. Bailu Si](https://sss.bnu.edu.cn/tabid/143/ArticleID/462/frtid/144/Default.aspx). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree of engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My Asian name 李昊天, where 李(Lee) is my family name, and 昊(Hau) 天(Ten), two individual characters as a whole, is my given name. It is sometimes interpreted as 'Haotian Li' as well.

FC Barcelona RULES!
